3. It is important to choose a license because having a proper license is needed for a software to be free. There are legal and copyright concerns surrounding software, and thus if the license terms are not clarified a software can not be classified as free. 

4. You should not use a project that doesn't have an explicit liscense because if the project lacks a liscense it is not truely free. The developer could revoke your access or retroactive add restrictions without any wrongdoing on your end.

5. I agree with this claim, had Gopher managed to follow the Open System Model, it may have not been surpassed by the web. If Gopher had followed this model, developerment community would have likely taken more of an interest in it rather than preferring the web for it's open development and thus gopher could have persisted and become competetive with the web.

6. Linux uses the GPL v2, as it was created specifically to be a free software. [It's principle author Linus Torvalds decided to create an operating system due to the licensiving MINIX, restricting it to educational use.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#Creation) Linux utilizes GNU applications because the freely available code was more advantagous to the operating system.
