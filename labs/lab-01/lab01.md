  ## Open Source Definition  
  The criteria for something to be considered open source is important because there is much more to it than just allowing access to the source code, such as allowing derived works, not discrimiation against persons, groups or fields of endevor, and more.

  ## Free Culture
  From reading Chapter 3, I have learned that even when someone has nominally done nothing wrong, larger organizations and more powerful people may go after them. They may do this   to make a point or to make money. They cost of being sued and fighting it is so great that even winning would leave you bankrupt. Even if something is available for you to use,   and you are even encouraged to do so, you can not be too careful with what might come of your use. All Jesse had done was make a search engine easier to use and due to it he       was sued for an immense amount of cash. You also must be careful even if you are just creating a system to assist with catologuing, as you may end up being forced to take         resposibility for the items in the catologue. If something has been catologued by your system that may even possibly fall under piracy, you may end up taking the fall. Thus, you   must be careful of the results of your work, not just the intentions.

# Reflection
I do not exactly understand what "Add a paragraph on how you are doing this activity to lab01.md" is asking. Is it referring to specifically to the Reflections section, ie picking a Open Source Project, or rather is it asking about lab1 as a whole
