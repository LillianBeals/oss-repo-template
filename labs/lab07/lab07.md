# Lab 07 Report

## Checkpoint 1
I was unable to get Checkpoint 1 working. I just kept recieving [this error](https://github.com/LillianBeals/oss-repo-template/blob/master/labs/lab07/images/Checkpoint1_Error.png)

## Checkpoint 2
1.  * You can see what tests were run by clicking on the number of not runs, fails, and passes
    * You can see what the error condition was by clicking on the name of the failed test
    * For a system that is close to my specific configuration in the Masters section, the dashboard is clean and there are no erros that I need to be concerned with.
   
2-4. I was unable to get the system to build as state in Checkpoint 1

## Checkpoint 3
As stated in checkpoint 1 I am unable to get the system to build and work.

## Checkpoint 4
As stated in checkpoint 1 I am unable to get the system to build and work so I have nothing to push to Github.
