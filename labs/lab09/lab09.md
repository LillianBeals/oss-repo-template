# Checkpoints 1-4
I followed the tutorial to install MongoDB on WSL as seen [here](https://dev.to/seanwelshbrown/installing-mongodb-on-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-2-19m9). I successfully completed Steps 1-5 however instead of MongoDB working, I instead simply faced this error seen [here](https://github.com/LillianBeals/oss-repo-template/blob/master/labs/lab09/images/MongoDB_Error.png). This error was mentioned in the top comment on the tutorial for installing MongoDB on WSL, but there was no reply on how to solve this issue. As such I was unable to progress with the checkpoints.
